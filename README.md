## Building
The engine is built using vscode, so you don't need to download Visual Studio or anything like that.

### Windows
Run the **build.sh** file and it should automatically compile the project and run it

It is *also* possible to use the **build.bat** file to compile the project, but it has *NOT* been tested, its much safer to use **build.sh**

### Linux
Run the **build.sh** file and it should compile and run the project
